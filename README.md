Air-Force-Complaint-Locator
===========================

An HTML5 Application which displays the numbers of complaints the Air Force has recieved according to the user's input. These numbers will ideally be used for statistical purposes within the Air Force civilian offices. To execute the application, open index.html with Mozilla Firefox. Do not open it in any version of IE since it does not support HTML5. It can be opened in Google Chrome properly, but there is some shortcoming concerning the functionality. This project was developed with the Aptana Studio 3 plugin to Eclipse.
